A funyy thing that I noticed is,
if you put 

.rt{
            -webkit-animation-play-state: running;
        }

        .stRt{
            -webkit-animation-play-state: paused;
        }


ahead of

        .rotateCD{
            -webkit-animation:5s linear 0s normal none infinite spin;
        }
        

The animation won't stop after clicking.
I've checked lots of information and dig up nothing helpful.

Anyone knows ?
